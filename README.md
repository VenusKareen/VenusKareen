🌟 Welcome to my GitHub playground! 🌟
🎮 When I'm not writing code, you can find me:

Exploring virtual worlds 🕹️
Reading tech blogs and fantasy novels 📚
Experimenting classical repertoires with my sax
💬 Let's connect and chat about code, jazz/classical music, or your favorite book! You can reach me on X or LinkedIn.

⭐ Be sure to check out my projects below and give them a star if you find them interesting!



Here's a little about me in code:

```python
class AboutMe:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Venus Kareen"
        self.pronouns = ["She", "Her"]
        self.code = ["Python", "JavaScript", "Java", "PHP", "Laravel" , "HTML/CSS"]
        self.tools = ["VS Code", "Git", "GitHub", "Android Studio"]

    def say_hello(self):
        print("Thanks for stopping by! ✨ Let's code something amazing together! 🚀")

me = AboutMe()
me.say_hello()
