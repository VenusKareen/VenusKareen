Here's a little about me in code:

```python
class AboutMe:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Venus Kareen"
        self.pronouns = ["She", "Her"]
        self.code = ["Python", "JavaScript", "Java", "Swift", "HTML/CSS"]
        self.tools = ["VS Code", "Git", "GitHub", "Docker", "Unity"]

    def say_hello(self):
        print("Thanks for stopping by! ✨ Let's code something amazing together! 🚀")

me = AboutMe()
me.say_hello()
